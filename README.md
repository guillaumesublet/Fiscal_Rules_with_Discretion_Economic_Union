# Fiscal_Rules_with_Discretion
This repository contains the code to compute the examples in Section 5 of the following paper: 

Guillaume Sublet (2021) "Fiscal Rules with Discretion".

The code is in [Python](https://www.python.org).

Structure of the repository:
----------------------------
* `src` contains the source code which defines the class Class_FiscRule.py
* `output` contains the figures produced by running the codes
* `Execution_small_open_economy.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that runs Class_FiscRule.py to produce Figure 1
* `Execution_economic_union.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that runs Class_FiscRule.py to produce Figure 2

To run the code:
----------------
The [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/quantecon-py/) library is needed for the interpolation routine. The core Python library is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

The code runs in a split second on a personal computer.
